Features
1. Dynamic Slice Generation: Easily generate any number of slices on the spin wheel to fit your requirements.

2. JSON Configuration: Define each sliceâ€™s data in a JSON file. The spin wheel will dynamically adjust according to the provided JSON data.

3. Configurable Probabilities: Gain precise control over the spin wheel economy by configuring probabilities. This ensures you can manage reward distribution effectively when the user presses the spin button.

4. Controlled Stop Index: Stop the spin wheel at any desired index. For example, if there are 8 slices, you can stop anywhere from index 0-7, and the spin wheel will still appear natural and seamless.

5. Optimized Code: The codebase is optimized and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles. Scriptable Objects are used for dependency injection, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

6. Highly Configurable System: The entire spin system is highly configurable via a configuration file. Enable test mode for infinite spins, adjust spin duration, total cycles, stop index, and customize the animation curve as needed.
